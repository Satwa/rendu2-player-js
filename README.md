# Video player library

Made in vanilla JS, this library can handle multiple instances of video tags to convert it into a custom player.

### Controls
 - Use Space bar to toggle play/pause
 - Use F to toggle fullscreen
 - Use P to toggle picture-in-picture
 - Use up/down arrows to volume up or down
 - Use left/right arrows to move backward or forward


### How to use
 - Create a new instance of VideoPlayer with player container CSS selector
 - Add all required elements (look at example code here)


### How to improve this library?
 - Provide a way to customize CSS selector elements
 - Allow to choose colors for each item (foreground/background)
 - Allow to add a poster to video when not playing
 - Fix preview not working correctly
 - Improve mobile support *(such as double tap, to go forward/backward)*
 - Add a big PLAY button on center when not playing
